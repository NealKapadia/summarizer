# OpenOrca - Mistral - 7B - 8k - Slim Data!

We have used our own [OpenOrca dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) to fine-tune on top of [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1). 
This dataset is our attempt to reproduce the dataset generated for Microsoft Research's [Orca Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707).
We use [OpenChat](https://huggingface.co/openchat) packing, trained with [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl).

This model is being released as a demonstration of the performance of our new curated subset of the OpenOrca data: **[SlimOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/SlimOrca)**.

This new dataset release provides an efficient means of reaching performance on-par with using larger slices of our data, while only including ~500k GPT-4 completions.

HF Leaderboard evals place this model as TBD

Codename: "*MistralSlimOrca*"

We are in-process with training more models, so keep a look out on our org for releases coming soon with exciting partners.

We will also give sneak-peak announcements on our Discord, which you can find here:

# Quantized Models

Quantized versions of this model are generously made available by [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).

- AWQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-SlimOrca-AWQ
- GPTQ: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-SlimOrca-GPTQ
- GGUF: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-SlimOrca-GGUF


# Prompt Template

We used [OpenAI's Chat Markup Language (ChatML)](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/chatml.md) format, with `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` tokens added to support this.

This means that, e.g., in [oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/) the "`MPT-Chat`" instruction template should work, as it also uses ChatML.

This formatting is also available via a pre-defined [Transformers chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating),
which means that lists of messages can be formatted for you with the `apply_chat_template()` method:

```python
chat = [
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are MistralSlimOrca, a large language model trained by Alignment Lab AI. Write out your reasoning step-by-step to be sure you get the right answers!"}
  {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am doing well!"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Please tell me about how mistral winds have attracted super-orcas."},
]
tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)
```

which will yield:

```
<|im_start|>system
You are MistralSlimOrca, a large language model trained by Alignment Lab AI. Write out your reasoning step-by-step to be sure you get the right answers!
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
How are you?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I am doing well!<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Please tell me about how mistral winds have attracted super-orcas.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
```

If you use `tokenize=True` and `return_tensors="pt"` instead, then you will get a tokenized 
and formatted conversation ready to pass to `model.generate()`.


# Inference

See [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/tbd) for inference details.

Note that you need the development snapshot of Transformers currently, as support for Mistral hasn't been released into PyPI yet:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```


# Evaluation

## HuggingFace Leaderboard Performance

We have evaluated using the methodology and tools for the HuggingFace Leaderboard, and find that we have dramatically improved upon the base model.
We find **106%** of the base model's performance on HF Leaderboard evals, averaging **65.85**.


This is also **98.6%** of *`Llama2-70b-chat`*'s performance!

![HF Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/Open-Orca/Mistral-7B-SlimOrca/resolve/main/Images/MistralSlimOrca7BHFLeaderboard.png)


| Metric | Value |
|-----------------------|-------|
| MMLU (5-shot)         | 62.77 |
| ARC (25-shot)         | 62.54 |
| HellaSwag (10-shot)   | 83.86 |
| TruthfulQA (0-shot)   | 54.23 |
| Avg.                  | 65.85 |

We use [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to run the benchmark tests above, using the same version as the HuggingFace LLM Leaderboard.


## AGIEval Performance

We compare our results to the base Mistral-7B model (using LM Evaluation Harness).

We find **tbd** of the base model's performance on AGI Eval, averaging **tbd**.
As well, we significantly improve upon the official `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` finetuning, achieving **tbd** of their performance.

## BigBench-Hard Performance

We find **tbd** of the base model's performance on BigBench-Hard, averaging **tbd**.

## GPT4ALL Leaderboard Performance

We ... averaging **tbd**.

## MT-Bench Performance

MT-Bench uses GPT-4 as a judge of model response quality, across a wide range of challenges.
We find our performance is *on-par with `Llama2-70b-chat`*, averaging **6.86**.

# Dataset

We used a curated, filtered selection of most of the GPT-4 augmented data from our OpenOrca dataset, which aims to reproduce the Orca Research Paper dataset.

The key change in this dataset is that we've done an additional pass, using GPT-4 to remove answers which appear wrong based on the human annotations from the FLAN dataset.
This reduces the dataset size to only ~500k entries, allowing training to a similar quality level to our previous releases with 2/3 the compute requirement.


# Training

We trained with 8x A6000 GPUs for 40 hours, completing 4 epochs of full fine tuning on our dataset in one training run.
Commodity cost was ~$240.
